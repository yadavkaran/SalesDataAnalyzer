Columns: sales_id, product_id, owner_id, timeperiod_id, city_id, store_id, profit_loss, percent.
Normalization: The table is in 3NF as all non-primary key columns are functionally dependent only on the primary key (sales_id), and there are no transitive dependencies.

city:
Purpose: Contains information about different cities.
Columns: city_id, city_name.
Normalization: This table is in 3NF because each column is directly dependent on the primary key (city_id), and no other dependencies exist.

owner:
Purpose: Stores information about product owners.
Columns: owner_id, owner_name, owner_email.
Normalization: It's in 3NF as each attribute is functionally dependent on the primary key (owner_id), and no transitive dependencies are present.

product:
Purpose: Manages details about products.
Columns: product_id, product_name, product_desc, owner_id, product_price.
Normalization: The table adheres to 3NF. The non-key attributes are dependent on product_id, and it contains no transitive dependencies since owner_id acts as a foreign key linking to the owner table.

timeperiod:
Purpose: Holds information regarding specific time periods.
Columns: timeperiod_id, timeperiod_name, displayflag, displayorder.
Normalization: It's in 3NF because each attribute is dependent on the primary key, and there is no dependency between non-key attributes.

store:
Purpose: Details of various stores.
Columns: store_id, store_name, owner_id, address, city_id.
Normalization: This table is in 3NF. All attributes are functionally dependent on the primary key, and owner_id and city_id serve as foreign keys.

users:
Purpose: Manages user login credentials.
Columns: id, email, password.
Normalization: This table is in 3NF as there are no dependencies among non-key attributes and each attribute is solely dependent on the primary key (id).
